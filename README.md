# xtreme-games
This is a site created for people who have nothing to do at work or at school. It contains several cool games you can play like the iconic pacman and snake. You can also play tic-tac-toe against the minimax AI with 6 levels from totaly random to the unbeatable level 6.

The games are all 2D so it is in a canvas ofcourse. The project is fully coded in html5, css3 and javaScript ES6.
